# Ansible: 
Ansible can be understood as an open-source information technology (IT) engine that is used for the automation of services like application deployment, 
provision of the cloud, intra-service orchestration, and many more.

It is used to address a wide range of automation difficulties with significant productivity improvements.

a) It is a configuration management tool, open source.
b) It uses yaml scripting.
c) It works on push management
d) By using Ansible , you can contorl multiple servers
e) It is Agentless and communication through ssh.
f) Scripts are called Playbooks
g) Ansible is Light weighted and Automation Friendly.

# Features of Ansible:
Ansible was developed with multi-tier deployment in mind. 
Ansible models IT architecture by specifying how all of your systems are interconnected rather than managing one system at a time. 
Because Ansible is entirely agentless, it connects your nodes using SSH to function (by default). 
However, Ansible gives you the option of using another connection technique, such as Kerberos.
Due to the lack of agents or specialized security infrastructure, Ansible is simple to deploy.

# What is Anisble Core
CLI: This include ansible,ansible-playbook, ansible-docs, and numerous other command line utilizes for driving and intreacting with automation.

Language: Ansible uses YAML to create a very succinct but powerful set of rules for developing Ansible Playbooks.

Framework: This architecture allows pluggabiltiy by using collections to be installed and operated from Automation Hub and Ansible Galaxy.

Functions: This includes conditionals,blocks,loops and other Ansible imperatives.

# Ansible Important terms:

1) Ansible Server:
 The machine where Ansible is installed. Playbooks can be run here.
 
2) Module: 
  Command or set of Commands to be executed on Client Side
  
3) Invnetory:
  File Containing data about Client Server. By using inventory you connect with your Client server.
  
4) Play: 
   Bascially It is a task which u want to executed on server.
   
5) Ad Hoc Command:
   It can be performed individually to perform a quick function
   
# Why using Ansible
Ansible is open-source, i.e., free to use for everyone. 
Ansible is relatively consistent and lightweight and not dependent on the operating system or if the hardware is present or not. 
It is secure because of its agentless capabilities and features of open SSH security.
Ansible does not need special system administrator skills for its installation and usage.
Ansible has an easy learning curve because of its thorough documentation and simple structure and setup.
Ansible is the ideal partner for orchestrating big environments due to its modularity regarding plugins, inventories, modules, and playbooks.

   
# for installing Anisble:

   Sudo apt install ansible
   
# open inventory file:
  /etc/ansible/hosts
  
  Insert the value inside inventory file
  
  [servers]
  server1  ansible_host=IP
  
  [all:vars]
  ansible-python-interpreter=path
  
  To check Test Connection:
  ansible all -m ping -u root or --private-key=Path
